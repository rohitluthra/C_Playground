 * Dynamic Memory Allocation
        The basic steps used for dynamic memory allocation in C are:
        1. Use a malloc type function to allocate memory
        2. Use this memory to support the application
        3. Deallocate the memory using the free function

    /*
     * A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is never used again but is not freed. This can happen when:
     *      The memoryâ€™s address is lost
     *      The free function is never invoked though it should be (sometimes called a hidden leak)
     *
     * A problem with memory leaks is that the memory cannot be reclaimed and used later.
     * The amount of memory available to the heap manager is decreased. If memory is repeatedly allocated and then lost,
     * then the program may terminate when more memory is needed but malloc cannot allocate it because it ran out of memory.
     *
     * In extreme cases, the operating system may crash.
